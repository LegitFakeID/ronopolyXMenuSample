# ronopolyXMenuSample
A few select sample files from menu section for RonopolyX, a remake of Ronopoly. 
The initial framework, of the board section, of the game is on a separate repo, at https://github.com/LegitFakeID/ronopolyXSample

The menu section is the initial part of the game where the player loads in, and accesses the matchmaking, inventory, shop, etc.

Most of this code was written in April-August 2023.
